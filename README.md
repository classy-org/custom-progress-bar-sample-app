# Custom Progress Bar Sample App

This is a sample application that demonstrates how to create a custom progress bar with your Classy data. It should be used purely as instructional material rather than a production-ready application.

Please refer to Classy's [developer documentation](https://developers.classy.org/overview/welcome) for more information about how to work with our product.

This application shell makes use of a
[Node backend layer](https://nodejs.org/en) to handle requests between the application and Classy's API as well as a [React frontend](https://react.dev/) to create a Client for the data retrieved from the customer's Classy account.

You can find the backend layer in the `/backend` folder (and setup instructions [here](/backend/README.md)) and the frontend part of the application in the `/frontend` folder (and setup instructions [here](/frontend/README.md)).

Please clone the repository and follow the instructions in the respective README files to get started.
